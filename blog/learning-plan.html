            <li>
                What is your long term goal or career pathway?
            </li>
            <small>
                A career in tech. I don't really care about where I end up whether it be frontend or backend or anything else. 
            </small>
            <li>
                A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
            </li>
            <small>
                I have these great short bursts of work however I often end up tired/burnt out if I'm not careful.
            </small>
            <li>
                What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
            </li>
            <small>
                Better communication skills. To be better at communicating my work as well as my feelings/emotions/attitude/etc.
            </small>
            <li>
                A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
            </li>
            <small>
                I plan on communicating with whomever I feel comfortable with whether it be a facilitator or a classmate if I cannot solve my problems alone. I hope to be more vulnerable when it comes to sharing so I won't be left behind or alone in this journey. I will take regular breaks and schedule downtime/exercise to keep my mind and body healthy.  
            </small>
            <li>
                A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
            </li>
            <small>
                I expect facilitators to guide students in the right direction to help us learn as efficiently as possible.
            </small>
            <li>
                Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
            </li>
            <small>
                I have no life. I plan on working later in the day as I am most productive then. (Around 14:00-23:00)
