      <div class="main-content">
      <div class="margin">
        <h2>Margin</h2>
        Margins define the space outside the border of an element. 
        They create a gap between the element and its neighboring elements. 
        Margins can be set individually for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, left), 
        or you can use the shorthand property to set them all at once. 
        <p>The margin property accepts various units of measurement like <br>- <br>pixels (px), percentages (%), em, rem, etc.</p>

      <div class="border">
        <h2> Border</h2>
        Borders are lines or outlines that surround the content and padding of an element. 
        They provide a visible boundary around the element. 
        Borders can be customized in terms of style, color, and width. 
        You can set these properties individually using border-style, border-color, 
        and border-width, or you can use the shorthand property border to set all three at once.

      <div class="padding">
        <h2>Padding</h2>
        Padding defines the space between the content of an element and its border. 
        It creates an inner space within the element. Padding can be set individually for each side of an element 
        (top, right, bottom, left), or you can use the shorthand property to set them all at once. 
        <p>The padding property accepts various units of measurement like <br> - <br>pixels (px), percentages (%), em, rem, etc.
