<h4>
    blocked on a simple problem
</h4>
<p>I was stuck on a simple problem where I had written a line of code that was in the wrong place, I felt very stuck and so I used a<br>
    few simple problem solving techniques that allowed me to progress. I used googling, console logging and asking peers<br>
    as a solution(in that order). I eventually worked it out on my own as my peers gave me clues on what I had written incorrectly<br>
    Through this process, I learned that struggle is a part of the process but problem solving techniques help progress through<br>
    these struggles.

<h4>
    elegantly solved a problem
</h4>
<p>
    I solved a problem during the javascript introduction's function section. It was the last question of this section and I was<br>
    mulling over this question for hours. I was to take a function with a parameter to console log it with the parameter duplicated<br>
    with a space between each string, so the return would be the same value twice. After a very long time trying to bash the answer<br>
    out of my keyboard, I just read the error messages and rewrote the code several times until the error messages went away.<br>

<p>
    Throughout my learning, I've primarily used reading error messages, console.logging and googling. I am extremely confident <br>
    in my ability to use these problem solving techniques. Despite using the other techniques significantly less, I think I<br>
    would still be proficient in using the other techniques. If all else fails, I can always just ask for help.

<h4>
    Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. <br>What might you try differently next time.

<p>
    I remember on the very first week of foundations, I had setup my computer incorrectly. I was so stubborn and fixated on<br>
    solving the problem myself that I ended up smashing my head against my monitor for 2 days. I ended up not even reaching out<br>
    for help until I had noticed someone else with the same issue as me. Only then did I message in the group that I needed a hand.
