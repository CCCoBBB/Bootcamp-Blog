    <h4>
        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?
    </h4>
    <p>
    I've learned that I don't get as easily stressed as I did in high-school. I managed my emotions and protected <br>
    my mental state by meditating and stopping when I felt like I couldn't keep pushing.  
    </p><hr>
    <h4>
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming? 
    </h4>
    <p>
    Our values shape how we live our lives. Values shape our behaviour, attitudes and beliefs. What we value determine <br>
    how we learn and grow as developers. <br><br>
    Empathy enables us to communicate better, build stronger relationships and cooperate more efficiently with other<br>
    individual in our programming space. <br><br>
    Self-awareness helps us to recognize our strengths and weaknesses which we can then acknowledge and recieve help<br>
    based on what we are good at and what we are bad at.<br>
    </p><hr>
    <h4>
        What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
    </h4>
    <p>
    The effectiveness of taking a step back to meditate. I feel so much less of weight on my life in general.
    </p><hr>
    <h4>
    What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
    </h4>
    <p>
    Learning how to think like a programmer is quite challenging. Learning to think in a different way was quite <br>
    confusing to try and do. I usually take on a problem at its face value and not break it down at all. Throughout<br>
    foundations, I've broken down  problems into smaller problems and it's definitely helped. <br>
    </p><hr>
    <h4>
    Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on<br> core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
    </h4>
    <p>
    These core lessons help us transition from a student programmer into an efficient programming employee.<br>
    These lessons also prepare us for things like interviews and how to collaberate and communicate <br>
    with other programmers to be more productive.
    </p><hr>
    <h4>
    Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you<br>
    have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
    </h4>
    <p>
    I think if we only worked on programming and how to code well, we would end up burnt out significantly<br>
    faster and out of a job too because we wouldn't perform very well as an employee. We wouldn't have good<br>
    soft skills that are needed for a job in this industry.
