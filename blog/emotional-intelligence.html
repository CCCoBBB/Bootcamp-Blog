    How is EQ different to IQ?
</h4>
<p>
IQ or intelligence quotient refers to a standardized scoring system to measure an individual's intelligence. The IQ test measures an <br>
individual's capacity for problem-solving, rational thought, and understanding or expressing complicated concepts. Compared to EQ which<br>

<h4>
    Why is EQ important?
</h4>
<p>
    It is crucial to be socially and emotionally self-conscious in order to control your own emotional thoughts and behaviours and to<br>
    comprehend the feelings, wants, and concerns of others. Since emotions have an impact on both your behaviour and that of people<br>
    around you, it is necessary to be aware of them. By developing your ability to communicate, create stronger relationships, make<br>
    wiser decisions, accomplish your goals, and resolve conflicts in a healthy way, emotional intelligence can help you thrive in life.<br>
    If you need to improve your emotional intelligence, don't worry; all it takes is time and effort. Emotional intelligence can be<br>
    learnt and reinforced.
