<h4>
    The relationship between Javascript, HTML and CSS      
    </h4>   
    <p>
    The relationship between these three computer languages can be compared to the skeleton, skin and muscle of a human.<br>
    CSS represents the skin of a human, as it designs the appearance. HTML represents the skeleton of a website, as it <br>
    represents the structure of a webstie. And finally the Javascript represents the muscle of a website. <br>
    </p>

<h4>
    Control flow and Loops
</h4>
<p>
The control flow and loops are vital concepts in javascript.<br>
For example, cooking dinner. There are multiple steps involved in cooking dinner, <br><br><b>The control flow</b>

    <li>Going to the supermarket </li>
    <li>Picking up groceries </li>
    <li>purchasing groceries </li>
    <li>driving home </li>
    <li>preparing ingredients</li>
    <li>cooking dinner </li>
    <li>eating dinner </li>
    <li>shitting </li>
</p>
<b>
    Loops
</b>
<p>
    loops could used from that process above to repeat a step within that process. <br>
    for example while preparing ingredients you may chop vegetables multiple times. <br>
    The preparing ingredients step would be repeated multiple times until all veges are chopped.<br>

<h4>
    The DOM
</h4>
<p>
    The DOM or Document object model, is a tree like structure that represents content on an HTML website. <br>
    The DOM can be used to manipulate elements of a website. The tree can be visualized as a familty where the root<br>
    would be the window/document itself. As the tree grows, the branches would represent big chunks of the document<br>
    such as a header or body or the footer. The smaller branches afterwards would be elements within the chunks<br>
    such as buttons, text or images.<br>

<h4>
    The difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
</h4>
<b>Arrays</b>
<p>
    An array is a list of data in a specific order. In order to access data from an array, you must use the<br>
    datas index value. For example in an array with four colours like this ['red', 'blue', 'yellow', 'green']<br>
    If you used the command console.log(colour[2]) The result would be yellow because an array begins with the number 0<br>
    <br>
  <b>Objests</b>
  <br>
  <p>
    Objects are a collection of data not in an order. To access data from an object the dot notation or bracket notation<br>
    must be used. For example, let's pretend our object is an drink like mountain dew. The in the object would be like<br>
    [sugar: '44.1g', energy: '759kj', protien: '0g', carbohydrate: '44.6g'] if access this data using console.log again<br>
    console.log(mountaindew.sugar) our result would be '44.1g'
  </p>
</p>

 <h4>
Functions
 </h4>
 <p>
    Functions are like smaller programs within code. They allow us to write instructions to perform tasks within our code.<br>
    There are many things a function can perform but as an example, we'll use the function add. If we write<br>
    function add(num1, num2){<br>
        return num1 + num2
    }<br>   
    lets results = add(2, 3)<br>
console.log(results)<br>
the result would show the number 5.
