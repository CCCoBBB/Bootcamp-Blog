        <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths</h1>
</section>
<h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
    </li>

        I call my friends out when they do things that could be considered harmful to themselves or to others. For example I often warn and remind my friends to stop overdrinking or using harmful substances even though it could make me seem like a buzzkill.  
    </small>
    <li>
        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.
    </li>

        I grew up Chinese in New Zealand. I was taught my whole life to live a traditional Chinese lifestyle so I think my values are very centered around Chinese values like benevolence, harmony, courtesy, respect and loyalty. However my friends who I grew up with has also taught me how to loosen up and enjoy life a bit more.

        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.

        I did the CliftonStrengths assessment about 6 months ago at a retreat. I found my top 5 strengths were the following in this order:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Activator - make things happen by turning thoughts into action. I want to do things now, rather than simply talk about them.
            </li>
            <li>
                Belief - I certain core values that are unchanging. Out of these values emerges a defined purpose for my life.
            </li>
            <li>
                Connectedness - I believe that things happen for a reason. (insignificant to this journey imo lol)
            </li>
            <li>
                Developer - I spot the signs of each small improvement and derive satisfaction from evidence of progress.
            </li>
            <li>
                Adaptability - enables me to respond willingly to the demands of the moment even if they pull me away from my plans. Unlike some, I don't resent sudden requests or unforeseen detours. I expect them. They are inevitable. On some level I actually look forward to them. 
            </li>
            </li>
        </ol>
        </small>
        <small>
            I think my first and fourth strength will be very supporing in this journey. They both seem very beneficial to a life of learning to code. 
        </small>
        <li>
            Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?
        </li>
        <small>
                I think my limitations would be primarily psychological where I would believe that I'm incapable of learning certain things. I experienced this in high-school physics a lot. I would get stuck on a problem and not know how to procede.
        </small>
        <li>
            Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
        </li>
        <small>
            I have only been involved in one group project I had in my high-school tech class. There were four of us and we delegated tasks to everyone based on their strengths. I ended up doing the majority of the work and we barely passed lmao.
